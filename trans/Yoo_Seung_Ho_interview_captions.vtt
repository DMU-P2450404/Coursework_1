That day…

01:11:633 --> 01:15.330 align:middle line:90%
this was happening long ago before my enlistment

01:16.167 --> 01:17.267 align:middle line:90%
But what I loved at that day was…

01:17.533 --> 01:19.733 align:middle line:90%
It was… How to say it

01:21.100 —> 01:24.467 align:middle line:90%
There were so many famous DJs in Hawaii

01:24.700 —> 01:29.900 align:middle line:90%
They made their own stands at the street with 20 - 30 people

01:30.233 —> 01:32.066 align:middle line:90%
They were standing in front of their favourite DJ

01:32.300 —> 01:37.033 align:middle line:90%
Whilst listening to the songs, they enjoyed their drinks

01:37.722 —> 01:40.200 align:middle line:90%
That night performance only for that night

01:40.330 —> 01:43.267 align:middle line:90%
Even though I don’t know how to play

01:43.267 —> 01:50.067 align:middle line:90%
but to see something like that was so interesting and so fun

01:50.300 —> 01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
That was what I remember the most

01:53.000 —> 01:54.000 align:middle line:90%

I will never wear this even though I want to

02:15.733 —> 02:19.467 align:middle line:90%
It’s for a photoshoot - I have to look cool

02:21.330 —> 02:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I can tell…

02:24.167 —> 02:27.933 align:middle line:90%

02:33.967 —> 02:37.033 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I’m not interested with clothes

02:38.367 —> 02:43.167 align:middle line:90%
I don’t even have interest in buying new t-shirts

02:43.600 —> 02:49.700 align:middle line:90%

I usually wear the same style but different clothes everyday

02:58.433 —> 02:59.767 align:middle line:90%
But…

03:01.400 —> 03:04.633 align:middle line:90%
I’m not a fashion terrorist

03:05.000 —> 03:07.600 align:middle line:90%
It’s just I only wear the regular clothes

03:07.733 —> 03:10.733 align:middle line:90%

03:10.733 —> 03:12.367 align:middle line:90%
No, no

03:12.667 —> 03:14.833 align:middle line:90%
